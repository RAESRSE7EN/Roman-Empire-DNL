          <strong>Born Gaius Octavius and also known as Octavian, Augustus Caesar transformed the Roman Republic, which was marred by civil wars, into a stable monarchic Empire in 27 BCE. Augustus, who reigned till 14 CE, dramatically enlarged his empire annexing numerous territories. In 98 CE, Trajan became the emperor of Rome. It was Trajan who led the Roman Empire during the greatest military expansion in Roman history. At the time of his death in 117 CE, the Roman Empire had reached its maximum territorial extent. It controlled land around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, North Africa and West Asia. It is estimated that the Roman Empire, at its peak, spanned over an area of around 5 million square kilometers. This made it one of the largest and most powerful empires till that point in history comparable to the Macedonian Empire of Alexander the Great and the Achaemenid Empire of Darius I which held 5.2 mi km2 and 5.5–8 mi km2 of area respectively</strong>

          #2 THE ROMAN ARCH BECAME A FOUNDATIONAL ASPECT OF WESTERN ARCHITECTURE

          <strong>An arch is a curved symmetrical structure which allows the weight of buildings to be evenly distributed along various supports, preventing massive structures from crumbling under their own weight. The arch thus allowed builders to make larger and more complex buildings. Although the arch was in use for centuries, it was the Romans who realized the enormous potential of the arch; perfected the technique of constructing them; and applied them to a wide range of structures. The Roman arch was the foundation of Rome’s architectural mastery. It allowed them to make bigger buildings, longer roads and better aqueducts. The arch is one of the single most important architectural discoveries in human history and it was the Romans who perfected it. The Roman arch became a foundational aspect of Western architecture and generated new systems of building across Europe.</strong>

        <strong>Though the aqueduct was devised much earlier in India, Egypt and Greece, the Romans improved on the structure. They constructed aqueducts throughout their empire building a complex and extensive network of water supply. The Romans used the aqueducts to bring water to their cities for drinking, irrigation and other purposes; as well as to channel waste water away from the cities to far away water bodies. Rome’s first aqueduct was built in 312 BC and they went on to create numerous aqueduct systems over the next 500 years. Most Roman aqueducts proved durable with a few still being partly in use. The aqueducts in Rome required a great deal of planning. They were made from a series of pipes, tunnels, canals and bridges. Aqueducts are regarded as perhaps the most important engineering feat of the Romans. Among the most renowned Roman aqueducts are Pont du Gard, Aqueduct of Segovia and Valens Aqueduct</strong>

          <strong>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an ancient oval amphitheatre in the city of Rome. Its construction began in 72 CE and it was completed by 80 CE. The Colosseum was used for gladiatorial contests and other public spectacles like dramas, animal hunts and mock sea battles. It is estimated that it could hold between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators; and had an average audience of around 65,000. The Colosseum is the largest amphitheatre ever built and it is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World. The Pantheon was another great structure build by the Romans. It was a Roman temple which was completed during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. The Pantheon has been in continuous use throughout history as it has been used as a church since the 7th century. Its most fascinating part is its giant dome, which was the largest in the world for 1300 years and it still remains the largest unsupported dome in the world.</strong>

          <strong>To ensure maintenance, development and effective administration of their huge state, the Romans built the most sophisticated system of roads the ancient world had ever seen. Roman roads were of various kinds ranging from small local roads to broad, long-distance highways which connected cities. At the peak of Rome’s development, the empire’s 113 provinces were interconnected by 372 great roads. The whole comprised more than 400,000 kilometers of roads. The Roman roads were constructed with a combination of dirt; gravel; and bricks made from granite or hardened volcanic lava. When the road encountered an obstacle, the Romans generally engineered a solution to the obstacle rather than redirecting the road around it. For example, bridges were constructed over water bodies and hills were tunneled through. The Romans incorporated many practical innovations in their road designs; and their roads were built to withstand floods and environmental hazards. Testimony to the engineering of Roman roads is that many of them are still used today despite having being constructed more than a millennium ago.</strong>
